# Welcome

Hello, my name is Bryan Veloso. Here lies my brain. (No, not really, that's disgusting. I need it.)&#x20;

This is a place where—if I remember—I'll post links and small snippets of information about my journeys through technology. I'm proudly self-taught in both web design and product development, but, like many, inspired by the vast sources of knowledge around me.

Sometimes I take that knowledge and make it my own, but never bother to write it down. So I either forget it, or forget to teach it. This is an attempt to mitigate that. If any of the pages within provide you any help in your journey, I am happier for it.
